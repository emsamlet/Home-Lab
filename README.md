# Home-Lab

## Objective

This project involved building a virtual home lab using VirtualBox to simulate a secure enterprise environment with multiple Linux and Windows virtual machines, a pfSense firewall, Splunk for log analysis, and Nessus for vulnerability scanning. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with system administration, network configuration, and security monitoring in a controlled, self-managed environment. This lab served as a practical foundation for understanding core cybersecurity concepts and tools.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Resource allocation and performance tuning (CPU, RAM, disk, networking)
- Installing and configuring Linux distros (Ubuntu, Kali, CentOS, etc.)
- Installing and configuring Windows Desktop editions
- IP addressing (static/DHCP), subnetting, and routing
- Installing and configuring pfSense as a virtual firewall/router
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- VirtualBox
- Kali Linux
- pfSense
- Splunk
